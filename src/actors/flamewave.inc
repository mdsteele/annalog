;;; State bytes for flamewave projectiles:
;;;   * State1: Counter that starts at zero and increments every frame; if it
;;;     wraps back around to zero before the flamewave hits a wall, then the
;;;     flamewave is removed.
;;;   * State2: How many times the flamewave has bounced off a wall.
;;;   * State3: Unused.

;;; The first tile ID for drawing flamewave projectile actors.
