Day 1: My name is
Jerome. It was I who
created the orcs.#

@PaperJerome01_Page2
In these pages, I feel
compelled to make my
confession.#

@PaperJerome02_Page1
Day 2: I had joined
the research effort as
a junior bioengineer
in early 2230.#

@PaperJerome02_Page2
It was a great honor
for me to be working
alongside the famed
Dr. Zoe Alda.#

@PaperJerome03_Page1
Day 3: In 2235 we had
the breakthrough that
made the creation of
the mermaids possible.#

@PaperJerome03_Page2
Dr. Alda envisioned a
newfound freedom for
anyone who wanted a
new life.#

@PaperJerome04_Page1
Day 4: As much as I
admired Dr. Alda, I
felt that we needed
a counterbalance.#

@PaperJerome04_Page2
Surely, not everyone
who wanted to change
would subscribe to the
mermaids' ideals.#

@PaperJerome05_Page1
Day 5: Indeed, most
who chose to become
mermaids were highly
idealistic.#

@PaperJerome05_Page2
They felt that they
could create a new
society without the
baggage of humanity.#

@PaperJerome05_Page3
A perfect society,
free of conflict and
greed.#

@PaperJerome07_Page1
Day 7: At least, that
was the idea. Clearly,
it failed.#

@PaperJerome07_Page2
A cautionary tale, if
only there were anyone
left to caution.#

@PaperJerome08_Page1
Day 8: The mermaids
seek utopia. They say
they've rid themselves
of hate and violence.#

@PaperJerome08_Page2
Of violence? I admit
that they seem to have
succeeded where humans
have always failed.#

@PaperJerome08_Page3
But of hate? Of pride?
They have only deluded
themselves.#

@PaperJerome09_Page1
Day 9: Meanwhile, the
orcs value conviction.
Honor. Valor. All fine
qualities.#

@PaperJerome09_Page2
But I fear they are
fast losing sight of
what they claim their
convictions stand for.#

@PaperJerome09_Page3
And so they, too, are
no better than us
humans.#

@PaperJerome10
Day 10: The orcs would
rule in our place, if
we let them. I doubt
that would go well.#

@PaperJerome11_Page1
Day 11: And yet, who
am I to judge? Perhaps
they would do better
than we did.#

@PaperJerome11_Page2
It's not as though the
bar is very high.#

@PaperJerome12_Page1
Day 12: So where do I
even start? We were a
great civilization
once, before the orcs.#

@PaperJerome12_Page2
But we were already
crumbling long before
they attacked.#

@PaperJerome13_Page1
Day 13: And now, there
is nothing left of us
but our machines.#

@PaperJerome13_Page2
I wonder for how long
those will keep on
working. A long time.
Maybe forever.#

@PaperJerome14_Page1
Day 14: It saddens me
that we couldn't build
a society as robust as
our technology.#

@PaperJerome14_Page2
We had the knowledge,
but not the wisdom
necessary. Nor the
humility we needed.#

@PaperJerome15_Page1
Day 15: Now facing our
apocalypse, I find
myself musing on how
it came to happen.#

@PaperJerome15_Page2
Our demise always
seemed likely, but
oddly, none of the
likely causes arose.#

@PaperJerome18_Page1
Day 18: We developed
artificial minds so
smart, they could have
ruled us. Enslaved us.#

@PaperJerome18_Page2
But it turned out that
they didn't want to.#

@PaperJerome19_Page1
Day 19: We sought
better life through
chemistry. We spewed
substances recklessly.#

@PaperJerome19_Page2
And yet, we eventually
got most of it cleaned
up. Enough of it,
anyway.#

@PaperJerome20_Page1
Day 20: In the end,
the problem wasn't our
technology. It was us.#

@PaperJerome21_Page1
Day 21: When Dr. Alda
created the mermaids,
she was trying to help
solve that problem.#

@PaperJerome21_Page2
But frankly, I think
she only made things
worse. Not that I did
any better, of course.#

@PaperJerome23_Page1
Day 23: But human
nature was still
there. The mermaids
proved this, I think.#

@PaperJerome23_Page2
The orcs, more so.#

@PaperJerome27_Page1
Day 27: By 2250 things
had settled down a
bit, but the mistrust
never really ended.#

@PaperJerome27_Page2
We built the Peace
Temple together with
the mermaids, but it
was a feeble gesture.#

@PaperJerome27_Page3
The orcs continued to
seethe. The mermaids
soon grew disgusted
with us both.#

@PaperJerome28_Page1
Day 28: We tried to
make peace with them,
of course. In the end
it wasn't possible.#

@PaperJerome28_Page2
But after all, that's
why we and they were
different in the first
place, isn't it?#

@PaperJerome31_Page1
Day 31: Despite how we
chose to use all our
technology, it needn't
have gone that way.#

@PaperJerome31_Page2
The complex core and
all these machines
could one day be put
to a different use.#

@PaperJerome34_Page1
Day 34: Our technology
is amazing, but lest
we forget, we're all
still just mortals.#

@PaperJerome34_Page2
No matter how high we
build, in the end the
grave still comes for
us all.#

@PaperJerome35_Page1
Day 35: I have hidden
the remote. Without it
the complex can never
be fully put to use.#

@PaperJerome35_Page2
I can't bring myself
to destroy our work.
Maybe, someday, we'll
be responsible enough.#

@PaperJerome35_Page3
Maybe someday...#

@PaperJerome36_Page1
Day 36: By now there's
probably not much time
left to finish this.#

@PaperJerome36_Page2
I'm going to start
pinning up all these
pages. Maybe someday
someone'll find them.#

@PaperJerome36_Page3
By then, I'm sure I'll
be long gone.#
