        Buried just beneath Anna's medieval home village lie the crumbled ruins
        of a long-dead civilization that once advanced by leaps and bounds,
        until its knowledge outpaced its understanding.  Now all memory of them
        is lost, and their forgotten machinery lies dormant underground,
        waiting for someone to revive and repurpose it.  Find yourself needing
        an elevator while exploring the caves?  A crane?  A weapon? You'll have
        to write the code that makes them go.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Bit by bit, you can reawaken all that ancient knowledge and power, and
        rediscover the history of how it once fell apart.  And who knows?
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        <strong>Maybe this time will be different.</strong>

        Featuring a sprawling world to explore, open-ended puzzles to solve,
        and mysterious lore to uncover, <em>Annalog</em> is the assembly
        programming Zachtroidvania you never asked for.

        <strong><em>Annalog</em> will be releasing for the NES in late
        2025.</strong>
